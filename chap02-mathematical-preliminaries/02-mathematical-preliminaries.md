# 2. Mathematical Preliminaries

## Sets, Relations, and Functions
Definitions to know:
  - **Set**: set comprehension, empty set, set difference, set cardinality, and
    powerset of a set.
  - The set of naturals and countability of a set.
  - An *n-*th place *relation*.
  - *Predicate* on a set S is a one-place relation.
  - *Binary relation*.
  - *Domain, range*, and *codomain* of a relation R.
  - *Partial* and *total* function.
  - A predicate P is *preserved* by a binary relation R on a set S, if whenever
    we have s R s' and P(s), we also have P(s').

## Ordered Sets
Definitions to know:
  - Reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and anti-symmetric binary relations.
  - A reflexive and transitive relation R on a set S is called *preorder* on S.
  - A preorder that is also anti-symmetric is called a *partial order*.
  - Total order.
  - Join (least upper bound), and meet (greatest lower bound).
  - Equivalence relation.
  - *Reflexive closure* of R is the smallest reflexive relation R' that
    contains R. Similarly, the *transitive closure* of R is the smallest
    transitive relation R' that contains R. Similar definition for *reflexive
    and transitive closure*.
