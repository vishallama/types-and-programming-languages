# 2. Mathematical Preliminaries

## Sets, Relations, and Functions
Definitions to know:
  - **Set**: set comprehension, empty set, set difference, set cardinality, and
    powerset of a set.
  - The set of naturals and countability of a set.
  - An *n-*th place *relation*.
  - *Predicate* on a set S is a one-placed relation.
  - *Binary relation*.
  - *Domain, range*, and *codomain* of a relation R.
  - *Partial* and *total* function.
  - A predicate P is *preserved* by a binary relation R on a set S, if whenever
    we have s R s' and P(s), we also have P(s').
